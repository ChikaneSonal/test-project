                <h2>Treatment Overview</h2>
                <p>Total Knee Replacement is a surgery to remove and replace the entire damaged knee joint with an artificial joint.<p>The procedure aims to relieve pain, improve mobility, and restore function to the knee joint.</p> 
                <p>During the surgery, the damaged portions of the knee joint are removed and replaced with <p>metal and plastic components designed to replicate the movement of a healthy knee.</p>
                <p>Recovery from Total Knee Replacement involves physical therapy and gradual return to normal activities.<p>Most patients experience significant improvement in pain and mobility within a few months post-surgery.</p>
